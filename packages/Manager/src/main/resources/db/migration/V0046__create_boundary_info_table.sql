    '<p>The Parkvale catchment is located on the lowland plains of the Valley floor streams Freshwater Management Unit group (FMU) in the RuamƒÅhanga Whaitua. The area is known for its high leaching soils and complex hydrologyand waterways. These waterbodies include the spring fed and intermittently flowing Parkvale stream and the Taratahi water race, which are fed by the Waingawa River. The catchment contains a mix of dairy/dairy support, sheep and beef farming, and lifestyle blocks, and sits between Carterton and Masterton townships.</p><p>This is an area of intensive farming activity and productive soils. The soils tend to be very thin, meaning ground and closely connected surface water are at risk of becoming polluted with highly soluble contaminants such as nitrates. The Parkvale is impacted by high nutrient levels, lowish flows and a lack of shading, meaning that periphyton can be a considerable problem.</p><p>Parkvale Stream is identified in Schedule H2 of the PNRP as a second priority water body for improvements for secondary contact recreation.</p>'
