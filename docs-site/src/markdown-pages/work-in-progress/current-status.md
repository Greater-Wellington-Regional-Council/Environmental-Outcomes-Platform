The EOP initiative is currently being incubated and led by a dedicated delivery team within Greater Wellington. This team consists of a Product Owner and Data and Software Engineers, and is working closely with subject matter experts from Greater Wellington and other councils.

The team has been operational since late 2022, and progress to date includes:
- Design and provisioning of initial cloud infrastructure to support the platform
- Development of our first [outcome](/#outcomes), a [Plan Limits Viewer](/work-in-progress/plan-limits)
- Establishment of a [Steering Grouop](/#steering-group)

### What's up next:

The roadmap for the few months includes:
- Iterating on the Plan Limits Viewer to include consented allocation amounts and usage
- Integrating data from other councils into the Plan Limits Viewer
- Establishment of a [Technical Working Group](/#technical-working-group)
