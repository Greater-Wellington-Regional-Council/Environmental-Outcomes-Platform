title: How to contribute

EOP is intended to be a sector-wide initiative with contributions from many
councils.

We're [currently working](/current-status) on integrating data from other
councils into the [Plan Limits Viewer](/plan-limits-viewer). If this is
something you are interested in, please get in touch.

We're also working towards technical contributions from other councils to the
platform. Once formed, the [Technical Working Group](/#technical-working-group)
will be esablishing guidelines for this, including an RFC process for
substantial changes.

In the meantime, if you're interested in following along with technical details,
check out the
[EOP](https://github.com/Greater-Wellington-Regional-Council/Environmental-Outcomes-Platform)
and
[EOP Infrastructure](https://github.com/Greater-Wellington-Regional-Council/Environmental-Outcomes-Platform-Infrastructure)
GitHub repos.
