Greater Wellington and other councils.

The team has been operational since late 2022, and progress to date includes:

- Design and provisioning of initial cloud infrastructure to support the
  platform
- Development of our first [outcome](/#outcomes), a
  [Plan Limits Viewer](/plan-limits-viewer/)
