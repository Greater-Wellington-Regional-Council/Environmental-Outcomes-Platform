# Environmental Outcomes Platform (EOP)

## Documentation

> Published documentation should be available [here](https://greater-wellington-regional-council.github.io/Environmental-Outcomes-Platform/)

All documentation for EOP should be defined in code as part of this repo, and deployed to GitHub pages. It is all very much a work in progress at this stage, with focus on high level of the 

Documentation so far has been built using C4 models with the [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/) tool. 

### Working on the Documentation

> Expect this process to change

Structurizr lite is used to automatically create C4 diagram images from code, and using the export function that is merged with supplementary documentation written in markdown files and then published as Github pages.

Workflow

Launching Structurizr locally

* `cd docs-site`
* `./batect structurizr`

Making changes

* Edit workspace.dsl file to update diagrams
* View on http://localhost:8090

Include diagrams in the site:

* Export diagrams via http://localhost:8090
* Save exported diagrams to the relevant folder in `src/markdown-pages`
* Update the relevant markdown file to incorporate diagrams into the site.
* `git commit` changes

### How to Run the application locally

To run Ha KƒÅkano locally, you will need to start the shared infrastructure services and then start the individual applications. 

#### Shared Infrastructure

You will need at least the following installed on your machine before you start:-
* A [JVM](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/?filtered-posts.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&filtered-posts.sort-order=desc) installed on the target machine in order to run the [Batect](https://batect.dev/) tool.
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* And of course a **git** tool of some sort to clone the repo to your machine

Shared services will expose the following ports that will need to be available before you start:-
* 5432 for Postgres
* 8080 for the Manager API
* 9092 for Kafka

With above in place, clone the repo to your machine and do the following from a command line shell to start the shared services:-
1. `cd packages/Manager`
2. `./batect runSupportServices`

_And from a new shell session in the same folder_

3. `./gradlew bootRun`

#### Application Packages

Having started the shared infrastructure, you will find specific run instructions for each application package in its own README.md file.  For example, [here are the run instructions for the Plan Limits UI](./packages/PlanLimitsUI/README.md).

## `start.sh` convenience script

To simplify running EOP locally, a `start.sh` script has been provided in the root of the repository.  This script will start the shared infrastructure services and then another application component that you name as an argument.

For example, to start the PlanUnitsUI application, you would run `./start.sh PlanUnitsUI`.
